## Description

_{This is a very basic webpage designed to perform very basic functions. It asks the user to answer 5 questions using select boxes in the user input part of the page. using jQuery, the scripts will then assign a number value to each response the user might choose. These values correspond to a certain destination output. The business logic of the script will then total the results and based on the total, will return a specific destination related to the total value. }_

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _Clone files from GitHub repository to Desktop._

_{I have no yet created a gh-pages branch for this project, so you will need to have the files copied or cloned to you local drive in order for this to work.}_

## Known Bugs
